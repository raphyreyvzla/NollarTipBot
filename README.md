NOLLAR Telegram Tip Bot

Commands

Thank you for using my services @NOLLARTipBot!  Below is a list of commands, and a description of how you can interact with me:

• !help: The NOLLARTipBot will respond to your DM with a list of commands and their functions. If you forget something, use this to get a hint of how to do it!n

• !register: Creates a fresh NOLLAR account address specifically for you.  This is used to store your tips. Make sure to withdraw to a private wallet, as the tip bot is not meant to be a long term storage device for NOLLAR.

• !balance: This shows you how much funds are in your your account.

• !tip: Tips are sent directly to @username on telegram.  Tag @NOLLARTipBot and mention !tip <amount> <@username>.  EXAMPLE: @NOLLARTipBot !tip 1 @user will send a 1 NOLLAR tip to another user.

• !account: Returns the account number.  You can use this to deposit more NOLLAR to tip from your personal wallet.

• !withdraw: Proper usage is !withdraw usd_12345.  This will send the full balance of your tip account to another external NOLLAR account.  Optional: You can include an amount to withdraw by sending !withdraw <amount> <address>.  Example: !withdraw 1 usd_123 would withdraw 1 NOLLAR to account usd_123
